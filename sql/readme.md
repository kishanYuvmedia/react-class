SQL Introduction with Examples
What is SQL?
SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language used to communicate with and manage data in a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, or Oracle.
----------------------------------------
Basic SQL Operations
Operation	Purpose
SELECT	Retrieve data from a table
INSERT	Add new data into a table
UPDATE	Modify existing data
DELETE	Remove data from a table
CREATE TABLE	Create a new table
DROP TABLE	Delete an entire table
Example Table: students
CREATE TABLE students (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  age INT,
  grade VARCHAR(10)
);

1. Insert Data
INSERT INTO students (id, name, age, grade)
VALUES (1, 'Rahul Sharma', 20, 'A');

2. Select Data
SELECT * FROM students;

3. Update Data
UPDATE students
SET grade = 'B',name="raj" WHERE id = 1;

4. Delete Data
DELETE FROM students
WHERE id = 1;

5. Filter with WHERE
SELECT name, grade
FROM students
WHERE age > 18;

6. Sort Results
SELECT * FROM students
ORDER BY age DESC;

7. Count Records

Types of SQL Functions
1. Aggregate Functions
Used to perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value.

Function	Description	Example
COUNT()	Counts rows	SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Students;
SUM()	Total of values	SELECT SUM(salary) FROM Employees;
AVG()	Average	SELECT AVG(age) FROM Users;
MAX()	Highest value	SELECT MAX(score) FROM Results;
MIN()	Lowest value	SELECT MIN(score) FROM Results;
2. String Functions
Function	Description	Example
UPPER()	Converts to uppercase	SELECT UPPER(name) FROM Users;
LOWER()	Converts to lowercase	SELECT LOWER(name) FROM Users;
LENGTH()	Length of string	SELECT LENGTH(name) FROM Users;
CONCAT()	Combine strings	SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) FROM Employees;
SUBSTRING()	Extract part of string	SELECT SUBSTRING(name, 1, 3) FROM Users;
3. Date Functions
Function	Description	Example
NOW()	Current date and time	SELECT NOW();
CURDATE()	Current date	SELECT CURDATE();
YEAR()	Extract year	SELECT YEAR(birthdate) FROM Students;
MONTH()	Extract month	SELECT MONTH(birthdate) FROM Students;
DATEDIFF()	Difference between dates	SELECT DATEDIFF(NOW(), '2024-01-01');
4. Mathematical Functions
Function	Description	Example
ROUND()	Round a number	SELECT ROUND(89.567, 1); â†’ 89.6
CEIL() or CEILING()	Round up	SELECT CEIL(12.3); â†’ 13
FLOOR()	Round down	SELECT FLOOR(12.9); â†’ 12
ABS()	Absolute value	SELECT ABS(-20); â†’ 20
MOD()	Modulus (remainder)	SELECT MOD(10, 3); â†’ 1
ðŸ’¡ Example Query Using Multiple Functions
SELECT 
  UPPER(name) AS Name_Uppercase,
  ROUND(salary, 2) AS Rounded_Salary,
  YEAR(joining_date) AS Joining_Year
FROM Employees
WHERE salary > 30000;

Â SQL JOINs â€“ Introduction
SQL JOIN is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

Â Assume Two Tables:
Customers
customer_id	name	city
1	Raj	Delhi
2	Meena	Mumbai
3	Ankit	Jaipur
Orders
order_id	customer_id	product
101	1	Laptop
102	2	Mobile
103	4	Headphones
1. INNER JOIN
Returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables.

SELECT Customers.name, Orders.product
FROM Customers
INNER JOIN Orders ON Customers.customer_id = Orders.customer_id;
Result:

name	product
Raj	Laptop
Meena	Mobile
2. LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)
Returns all records from the left table (Customers) and matched records from the right table.

If no match, returns NULL on the right side.

SELECT Customers.name, Orders.product
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.customer_id = Orders.customer_id;
Result:

name	product
Raj	Laptop
Meena	Mobile
Ankit	NULL
Â 3. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
Returns all records from the right table (Orders) and matched records from the left table.

If no match, returns NULL on the left side.

SELECT Customers.name, Orders.product
FROM Customers
RIGHT JOIN Orders ON Customers.customer_id = Orders.customer_id;
Result:

name	product
Raj	Laptop
Meena	Mobile
NULL	Headphones
Â FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)
Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table.

(Note: Not supported in MySQL, can simulate using UNION)

-- Not directly supported in MySQL
SELECT Customers.name, Orders.product
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.customer_id = Orders.customer_id
UNION
SELECT Customers.name, Orders.product
FROM Customers
RIGHT JOIN Orders ON Customers.customer_id = Orders.customer_id;
Result:

name	product
Raj	Laptop
Meena	Mobile
Ankit	NULL
NULL	Headphones
Use Case Summary:
JOIN Type	Use Case
INNER	Only matched data needed
LEFT	All left + matched right
RIGHT	All right + matched left
FULL	All data from both sides
